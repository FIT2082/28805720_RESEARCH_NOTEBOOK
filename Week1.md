Week 1: 30 July - 5 August
==========================

This week I discussed the aims and methodology the project would be following with my supervisors and Ramya. I looked into R, especially the book [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and the library [XTS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/index.html) on Christoph's recommendation. We can't start any serious work yet since we are waiting on plant data, which ought to be available some time next week.
