Week 6: 3 September - 7 September
=================================

Investigated different predictive models, looking also at past work such as 
"Machine learning methods for predicting failures in hard drives: A multiple-instance application".
Investigated group methods, k-mean clustering, multi-instancing, reverse arrangement, mean z-score, SVMs, U testing, 
random forests, gradient boosting and regression splines, as well as preprocessing techniques such as
binning, bagging, manual attribute selection, manual classification, single attribute analysis and 
attribute combinations. Also speculated on meta variables that could be introduced such as spin up count (the
frequency at which a michine is turned on and off).
