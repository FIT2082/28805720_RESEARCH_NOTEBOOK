Week 7: 17 September - 23 September
=================================

This week Arnaud asked us to try to recreate the Azure machine learning pipeline from last week in pure R. Christoph provided some code he had used in previous ML projects that utilises the [RWeka](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RWeka/index.html) library. We also discussed the possibility of making further improvements to the data visualisation code in order to gain more insight into the trends any predictive algorithm would need to recognise.
