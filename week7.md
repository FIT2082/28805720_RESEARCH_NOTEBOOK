Week 7: 10 September - 16 September
=================================

During week 7 Arnaud suggested we attempt to reproduce the results of the [Azure ML notebook of predictive maintenance](https://gallery.azure.ai/Notebook/Predictive-Maintenance-Modelling-Guide-R-Notebook-1). Ramya and I successfully reproduced the results shown in the R Notebook, and also [experimented](https://studio.azureml.net/Home/ViewWorkspaceCached/681087f0301d41198c41d85d6268b6eb?#Workspaces/Experiments/Experiment/681087f0301d41198c41d85d6268b6eb.f-id.a65382ce46c34d2c83b2d739e7c59a3e/ViewExperiment) with a few different classification algorithms in Azure, the results of which will probably be detailed in the final report. We can produce relatively high accuracy predictions (around 98%) however since the provided data is small and from one source, it is likely that the results may be due to overfitting. For reference, past studies have yielded accuracies closer to 50% (with no false positives).
